[The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial)\n4. <https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/environments/py/python.html>\n\n\n\n# Lecture \n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nMaterial for this lecture was borrowed and adopted from\n\n- <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate>\n\n## Learning objectives\n\n::: callout-note\n### Learning objectives\n\n**At the end of this lesson you will:**\n\n1.  Install the `reticulate` R package on your machine (I'm assuming you have python installed already)\n2.  Learn about `reticulate` to work interoperability between Python and R\n3.  Be able to translate between R and Python objects\n \n:::\n\n\n\n## Slides \n\n- [Lecture 12: Programming with Python in R with reticulate](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xk2ViA2-YPHYtvus6ikwHDuvTIcxUH4EoH-EylvJAwE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n# Class activity \n\nFor the rest of the time in class, you and your team will work on the final project. Stephanie will walk around to answer questions and to help in anyway I can. \n\n\n# Post-lecture\n\n## Additional practice\n\nHere are some additional practice questions to help you think about the material discussed.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Questions\n\n1.  Try to use tab completion for a function.\n2.  Try to install and load a different python module in R using `import()`.\n\n:::",
