# Pre-lecture activities

::: callout-important

In advance of class, please install two additional packages:

* `devtools` - this provides many additional tools for building packages
* `roxygen2` - this provides tools for writing documentation
* `pkgdown`  - this helps you to build a package website with little effort
* `usethis`  - an automation package that simplifies project creation and setup

You can do this by calling

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2",
                   "usethis", "pkgdown"))
```

In addition, please read through: 

- <https://r-pkgs.org>
- <https://stat545.com/package-overview>
- <https://usethis.r-lib.org>
- <https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown>
