# Pre-lecture activities

::: callout-important

In advance of class, please install:

* `reticulate` - this provides an interface between R and python

You can do this by calling

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages(c("reticulate"))
```


:::

In addition, please read through the pre-reading: 

- [Lecture 12: Programming in Python with reticulate](../../readings/12-programming-in-python/index.qmd)

And if there is time, these are useful too: 

1. <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate>
2. <https://py-pkgs.org/02-setup>
3. [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial)
4. <https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/environments/py/python.html>

## Learning objectives

### Learning objectives

**At the end of this lesson you will:**

1.  Install the `reticulate` R package on your machine (I'm assuming you have python installed already)
2.  Learn about `reticulate` to work interoperability between Python and R
3.  Be able to translate between R and Python objects

# Class activity 

For the rest of the time in class, you and your team will work on the final project. Stephanie will walk around to answer questions and to help in anyway I can. 


# Post-lecture

## Additional practice

Here are some additional practice questions to help you think about the material discussed.

### Questions

1.  Try to use tab completion for a function.
2.  Try to install and load a different python module in R using `import()`.
